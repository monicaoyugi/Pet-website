     <p>
       <strong> <em>Dogs are likely the most stereotypical</em></strong> pet for children – and there’s a reason for that. Most average-sized
        dogs are large enough to avoid being injured by your child, but many breeds are also calm and laidback with
        children. Canines easily live to a decade, so you shouldn’t have to worry about having that uncomfortable
        conversation with your child. This species is also trainable and can usually go anywhere your child can, so
        they make good everyday companions. However, dogs also need quite a bit of care. They’re going to need <strong>
        toys</strong> to prevent them from chewing on your furniture and a high-quality <strong>collar </strong> like this one. Children
        should not be expected to take care of a pet all by themselves – most of them will need help with this
        everyday care.
